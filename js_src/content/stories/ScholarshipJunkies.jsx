    <p>
      I develop and manage two key services for Scholarship Junkies: automated essay{' '}
      assignment for reviewers and a Google Docs-esque collaborative feedback platform for students.
    </p>
    <h3 style={styles.h3}>My Goal</h3>
    <p>
      To generate lasting impact in a broad spectrum of fields through the leverage of{' '}
      educational empowerment, and to tighten social gaps by providing high quality,{' '}
      distributed educational support to everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      My ability to deliver on these goals dependson my readiness to "fail fast" and "fail{' '}
      forwards", as well as on the incredible support of students and the greater Scholarship{' '}
      Junkies team.
